# Security

This is a hobby project created by a volunteer maintainer. Any security
properties are purely on a best-effort basis.

## Vulnerability Response

If you are impacted by a vulnerability in this project, you can report it by
opening an issue on GitHub. It will be addressed if a maintainer feels like it.
Reports that include an accompanying PR to fix the issue may be acted on more
quickly.

## RustSec

This project does not participate in RustSec. Affiliates of that organization
are asked not to file any advisories about this project, and should not attempt
to contact maintainers about real or imagined vulnerabilities in it.
